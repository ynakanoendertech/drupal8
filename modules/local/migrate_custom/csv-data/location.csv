Our workforce development curriculum was created with the support of The Deutsch Foundation and the expertise of Columbia University’s School of Social Work to help youth to become valued workers and competitive in today’s labor market.  In addition, we have over 20 businesses and organizations that provide viable internships to our youth with options for long-term employment and livable wages throughout San Gabriel Valley and the greater Los Angeles area. This is a place where preparation and opportunity meet. YMO offers two types of paid internship programs: job readiness and career tracks. Youth receive training that increases their competency and makes them a greater asset to the workforce and themselves.  Unemployed or underemployed youth benefit from individual and group training, job matching, and a Job Development Specialist that talks directly to employers about the youth’s strengths and areas for development.

Level 1: Crisis Shelter (immediate needs) With 64 beds in Los Angeles and 18 beds in the Bay Area, the focus of the crisis shelters is on providing immediate needs such as a safe environment, a warm bed, food and clothing. This allows a youth the chance to work with a case manager in creating a case plan that will help move them toward independent living. Level 2: Rights of Passage (transitional living program) In our transitional living program, a youth takes the initial steps in living independently. To qualify for the program, a youth must be in school or working full-time. If working, they are required to put a portion of their wages into savings. In addition, the transitional living program offers classes for basic life skills such as cooking, banking, money management, health issues and communication. Our Los Angeles campus has 24 beds for this program and the Bay Area has twelve. Level 3: Supportive Apartments Program (moving toward independent living Covenant House California has five off-site apartments that house ten youth who are in the final steps of living independently.
