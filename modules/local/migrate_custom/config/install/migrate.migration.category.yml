process:
  # The simplest process plugin is named 'get' - it is the default plugin, so
  # does not need to be explicitly named. It simply copies the source value
  # (the 'style' field from the source database in this case) to the destination
  # field (the taxonomy term 'name' field). You can see we simply copy the
  # source 'details' field to destination 'description' field in the same way.
  name: category

  # Here is a new plugin - default_value. In its simplest usage here, it is used
  # to hard-code a destination value, the vid (vocabulary ID) our taxonomy terms
  # should be assigned to. It's important to note that while above the right
  # side of the mappings was a source field name, here the right side of the
  # 'default_value:' line is an actual value.
  vid:
    plugin: default_value
    default_value: migrate_custom_category

  # Here's another new plugin - migration. When importing data from another
  # system, typically the unique identifiers for items on the destination side
  # are not the same as the identifiers were on the source side. For example, in
  # our style data the term names are the unique identifiers for each term,
  # while in Drupal each term is assigned a unique integer term ID (tid). When
  # any such items are referenced in Drupal, the reference needs to be
  # translated from the old ID ('ale') to the new ID (1). The migration
  # framework keeps track of the relationships between source and destination
  # IDs in map tables, and the migration plugin is the means of performing a
  # lookup in those map tables during processing.
#  parent:
#    plugin: migration
    # Here we reference the migration whose map table we're performing a lookup
    # against. You'll note that in this case we're actually referencing this
    # migration itself, since category parents are imported by the same
    # migration. This works best when we're sure the parents are imported
    # before the children, and in this case our source plugin is guaranteeing
    # that.
#    migration: beer_term
    # 'style_parent' is the parent reference field from the source data. The
    # result of this plugin is that the destination 'parent' field is populated
    # with the Drupal term ID of the referenced style (or NULL if style_parent
    # was empty).
#    source: style_parent
